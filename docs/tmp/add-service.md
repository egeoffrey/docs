Adding new services means providing eGeoffrey with new skills and, in order to make them available, new elements have to be placed in eGeoffrey's accommodation. As already introduced in the ["say hi to him"](../say-hi-to-him/getting-started-guide.md) section, the ```egeoffrey-cli``` utility helps in that matter and we'll show you how to do so.

In addition to this handy utility, there is an e-butlers online repository with tens of artifacts to give your eGeoffrey new capabilities; this repository is called eGeoffrey Marketplace and it's available at [marketplace.egeoffrey.com](https://marketplace.egeoffrey.com/). We encourage you to follow the link and have a look at everything that is at a *click distance*.
