# Working with icons

Whenever during the configuration you have the option of setting up an icon (to a sensor, in a widget, etc.), you are expected to reference the name of one of the icons already included within eGeoffrey. 

To see a list of the available icons:

* Connect to the eGeoffrey web interface, as an admin user and go to "**eGeoffrey**", "**Icons**" under "**ADMINISTRATION**".
* Search for a specific icon by name (e.g. temperature)
