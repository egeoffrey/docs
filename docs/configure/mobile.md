# eGeoffrey Mobile App

eGeoffrey Mobile App provides you with the same capabilities and user experience of the eGeoffrey's web interface.

## Installation

eGeoffrey App is available for now only on Android devices and can be downloaded directly from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.egeoffrey.app).

## Notifications

To receive notifications on the device where the Mobile App is installed even when the App is not running, you need to install on your eGeoffrey instance the package `notification/mobile` and configure it with the"Device Token" you can get from the "About" menu of the app.

## Remote Access

The Mobile App allows you to access your eGeoffrey instance even when you are outside of your local network, remotely. To do so, you need to [setup remote access](/configure/remote) and point the app to our Cloud Gateway.
